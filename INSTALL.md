# BunkoDEX installation guide
## Preamble
Although BunkoDEX is free software, this unfortunately does not mean that anyone automatically has all the skills to use it, study it, modify it and disseminate it in stability and security. Not because BunkoDEX is particularly sophisticated but because the computer security of any software is.<br>
That said, good installation!

* PHP >=  5.6
* MySQL or MariaDB
