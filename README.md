## How it work?

The BunkoDEX catalog system works in a very simple way:<br>
The numerical code consists of two members consisting of three digits, separated by a dot and a HEX sub-subcategory (always three characters).<br>
A pre-set table with the wiki of the main categories will be published shortly.

# INSTALL BunkoDEX

Read [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for correct installation of BunkoDEX.

## Little example
An Arch Linux CD.<br>
Main category:<br>
IT -> `(COD. 034)`<br>
Operating Systems in CD -> `(COD. 143)`<br>
The BunkoDEX code will be `034.143`<br>
For a more precise classification, an additional BunkoDEX identification code can be added after the sub-category.<br>
For example: ArchLinux is a Linux distribution.<br>
It is part of the IT category, therefore the COD. 034 is correct;<br>
Linux code is `D` -> Arch is `7F`<br>
So the complete BunkoDEX code for the Arch Linux CD will be:<br>
`034.143:D7F`<br>
*PS. All written codes are purely invented, in the official table they will be different. I remember that they can be customized to your liking, provided that the syntax remains the same.*
